# Equipment

The New York Public Radio Archive uses an array of current, obsolete and modified hardware and software in its media reformatting facility.

The Archive maintains an inventory of its reformatting equipment, which is availible [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kSEkJt2k-LeVuQredzU2NWK-w_89DR-ArFwPGn7sXdI/edit#gid=0); it contains separate tabs for equipment, phono styli, phono cartridges and software.  The Archive also maintains a repository of corresponding equipment manuals, in the pdf format; that repository is availible [here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1vIhrvPeaIRBc-uLLb5M1N69cPX5QI1kU)
